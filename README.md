# ical-helper
Calendar file creation helper for ical format.

You can hack it to easily create custom calendar files.
Out of the box it's prepared to create calendar files for events repeating at even intervals.
For example: create working / non working days for someone who works 3 days in a row, then doesn't work for other 3 days in a row and so on.
