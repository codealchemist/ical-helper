# ical-helper
Calendar file creation helper for ical format.

You can hack it to easily create custom calendar files.
Out of the box it's prepared to create calendar files for events repeating at even intervals.
For example: create working / non working days for someone who works 3 days in a row, then doesn't work for other 3 days in a row and so on.

## Running it
This is a nodejs app so you need nodejs installed on your system and npm to install required packages.
Once you have that, do:

`npm install`

`node index.js`

That should generate an ical file.
You should also see a log on the console.

Cheers.
